00:00:00,986 --> 00:00:02,050
(gentle electronic music)

2
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,470
So we learned before that Node.js

3
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:06,850
is all about asynchronous code,

4
00:00:06,850 --> 00:00:08,910
which was traditionally implemented

5
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:11,830
using callback functions, right?

6
00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,130
However, in modern JavaScript,

7
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:15,970
we now have some better tools

8
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,060
to deal with asynchronous code,

9
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,030
and these tools are Promises and Async/Await.

10
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:24,950
So I will use Promises and Async/Await

11
00:00:24,950 --> 00:00:27,220
in this entire course now,

12
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:29,080
well, because, that's just the way

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:32,130
modern Node.js code is written,

14
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,070
and so if you're not entirely familiar with these new tools,

15
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:39,620
well, then please go ahead and watch this short section

16
00:00:39,620 --> 00:00:41,380
which will bring you up to speed

17
00:00:41,380 --> 00:00:43,560
with asynchronous JavaScript.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:47,600
But of course, if you already know Promises and Async/Await,

19
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,703
then feel free to just entirely skip this section.
